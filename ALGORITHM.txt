ALGORITHM

Q. Implement an algorithm if an Nth is a divisor of an n number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so determine if it's an even number or odd number as well

Start
Ask user for two number where n is the number to be divided and Nth is the number which we will use to divide n
Use modulus operator between n and Nth and check the remainder
If the reminder is 0 then Nth is the divisor of n
If only the remainder is 0 
Use modulus operator again but this time between n and 2
If the remainder is still 0 then the number is even
Else the number is odd
End 

Q. Implement an algorithm where the user enters a number, and an appropriate month is displayed

Start
Set 1 for JANUARY
Set 2 for FEBRUARY
Set 3 for MARCH 
Set 4 for APRIL
Set 5 for MAY
Set 6 for JUNE
Set 7 for JULY
Set 8 for AUGUST
Set 9 for SEPTEMBER
Set 10 for OCTOBER
Set 11 for NOVEMBER
Set 12 for DECEMBER
Ask user for a number from 1 to 12
Check the input number
If the number enter by the user matches the number present in the data then print it's respective month
Else if ask the user to input another number between 1 to 12
End 

Q. Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+, -, *, /, %)

Start
Set + for Addition 
Set - for Subtraction
Set * for Multiplication
Set / for Division 
Set % for Remainder
Ask user for 2 numbers
Ask user for the operations he/she wants to perform with the input numbers
Apply the entered operation on those numbers
Display the results to the user
